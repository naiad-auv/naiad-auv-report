\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Since the project ran out of time the Sensor Controller was never completed.

\subsection{Future work}
The Sensor Controller will need to be tested with its sensors before it is used. \\
When purchased, the salinity sensor will need to be calibrated. No work has been done regarding calibration of the salinity sensor. The temperature and pressure sensors are also likely to need some form of calibration.
