\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The vision system is tested successfully in terms of booting an operating system from flash memory and executing the image processing files in it. The system can act accordingly based on the mission by receiving CAN messages and reply back when the mission is completed successfully.

\subsection{Future work}
One of the Ethernet ports is not mounted which can be fixed later on. Then the GIMME-2 board can act as a hub in receiving all the messages from the Mission Control System and transmit to the ground station about the current status of the AUV. 

When the PCB flaw of the SD card is fixed, proper operating systems like Ubuntu can be installed on the GIMME-2 board \cite{web:ubuntuZynq} which then doesn't have to rely on the pandaboard for compiling its source files. Even OpenCV can be installed on the GIMME-2 as Xilinx has already released the support for Ubuntu on the Zynq platform.
