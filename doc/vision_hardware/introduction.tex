\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
The primary objective of the vision system is to detect target objects of various shapes and colours and communicate to the other components within the robot to take necessary actions. The system comprises of two GIMME-2 stereovision boards \cite{gimme2manual} equipped with a hard processor \cite{hardp} called Zynq 7020 from Xilinx and two 10 Megapixel OV10810 \cite{OV10810} image sensors. The Zynq processor consists of an ARM Cortex A9 dual-core processor and a FPGA in the same silicon chip. The FPGA architecture augments the image processing capabilities of the system as it can do arithmetic operations in parallel, unlike the CPUs which do it sequentially. The board has 8 GB of RAM for the Processing System (ARM processor) and 4 GB of RAM for Programmable Logic (FPGA). There are two fast Ethernet ports and one gigabit Ethernet port for high speed communication with other devices. There is a slot for external memory storage where the image processing binary files are stored. The operating system installed on the GIMME-2 board is Linux (version 3.6.0-xilinx).
