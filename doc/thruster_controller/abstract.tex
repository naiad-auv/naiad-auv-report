   Every vehicle, by definition has a propulsion system which allows it to move. In the case of most AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) the propulsion system consists of one or more thrusters. In the "Naiad project" six thrusters were used to allow the vehicle to move underwater in all three planes X, Y and Z, the same setup used in the "Vasa project" \ref{•} which is an earlier AUV developed by a group of students at M\"{a}lardalen University, Sweden. For the "Naiad project" a different configuration of the thrusters than the one of "Vasa project" was chosen to allow it to be more agile and more responsive.
