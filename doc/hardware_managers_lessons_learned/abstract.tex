\begin{abstract}
In the beginning of the Naiad AUV Project I was assigned to be the manager of hardware development during the project. In this report I have written down my experiences and what I learned. My intended readers are primarily future students of this project course but also anybody else who participates in projects, primarily student projects, that include many people and span over longer times. \newline
