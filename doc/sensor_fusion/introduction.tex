The Sensor Fusion is divided into two parts: Software architecture and Sensor fusion calculations.

\subsection{Software architecture}
The responsibility of the Sensor fusion was from the beginning unclear. The design
choices that were made had to leave room for change in responsibility.
This could mean that the calculations that were supposed to be done later on would be 
more computationally heavy than first anticipated or perhaps, the other way around.
It was also important to make sure that neither the ethernet connection nor the CAN bus
connection were blocking the Sensor fusion calculations.

\subsection{Sensor fusion calculations}
The Sensor fusion calculations are aimed to calculate the attitude
(yaw, pitch and roll) and the position of the AUV in x, y and z
coordinates taking the starting position as the origin. Due to time and financial 
constraints that caused the ordering of IMU to be delayed, the Sensor fusion was never implemented.

is meant to guide the readers in the right direction and help them avoid
future mistakes.
