\begin{abstract}
   The Sensor Fusion of the Naiad AUV is done on a BeagleBone Black which takes care of
   computationally heavy calculations. Data is received from
   both an Ethernet connection and a CAN bus. The data is received as
   CAN messages independently of underlying technology in the current design.
   For long term maintainability of the code the Sensor Fusion code is divided
   into seven Ada tasks where each task has a specific responsibility.
